        <h1>Day 1: JavaScript Basics</h1>

        <h2>1.1 Overview of JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. When
            you see things like pop-up messages, sliders, and animations on websites, JavaScript is usually the magic
            behind it. It runs directly in the browser, which means that when you visit a website, the JavaScript code
            is sent from the server to your browser, where it is executed.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to Client-Side Scripting</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language. This means that it runs on the user's computer,
            inside their web browser, rather than on the server. When you click a button on a website and something
            changes instantly without reloading the page, that's JavaScript at work. This client-side scripting allows
            web pages to be more dynamic and responsive to user actions.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to Server-Side Scripting</h3>
        <p>Server-side scripting involves code that runs on the web server before the content is sent to the user's
            browser. Technologies like Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby are commonly used for server-side scripting.
            Server-side scripts handle tasks like processing form submissions, interacting with databases, and
            generating dynamic content before it reaches the client. Unlike client-side scripts, which run on the user's
            device, server-side scripts are executed on the server, and the result is sent to the user's browser as
            plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Difference Between Client-Side and Server-Side Scripting</h3>
        <p>Client-side scripting and server-side scripting are two different approaches to building web applications,
            each with its strengths and purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Side Scripting:</strong> Runs in the user's browser. It allows for interactive and
                dynamic content that can respond to user actions without needing to reload the page. JavaScript is the
                primary language for client-side scripting.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Side Scripting:</strong> Runs on the web server. It handles backend operations like
                database interactions, user authentication, and form processing. The server generates the content before
                sending it to the client's browser.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <h3>Evolution and History of JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape. It was designed to make web
            pages interactive and was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, before finally being named JavaScript.
            Despite its name, JavaScript has little to do with the Java programming language; the name was chosen for
            marketing reasons. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly. It was standardized as ECMAScript
            in 1997 to ensure compatibility across different web browsers. After a slow period in the early 2000s,
            JavaScript gained popularity again with the rise of AJAX, which allowed for dynamic content updates without
            reloading pages. Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages, powering a huge
            range of web applications and services.</p>

        <p>In summary, JavaScript has grown from a simple tool for making web pages interactive into a full-fledged
            programming language used both on the client side (in browsers) and the server side (with technologies like
            Node.js).</p>
